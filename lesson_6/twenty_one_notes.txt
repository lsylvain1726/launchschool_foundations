# start with a normal 52 card deck
# consists of 4 suits (hearts, diamond, clubs, and spades)
# 13 values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace)
# goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over
# if you go over 21, its a bust and you lose
# game consists of a dealer and a player
# both players initially dealt two cards, but can only see one of dealers cards
# numbers 2 through 10 are worth there face value
# jack, queen and king are each worth 10
# ace can be worth 1 or 11
# ace value is determined each time a new card is drawn from the deck
# if hand contains 2, ace, and 5 then total value is 18
# account for multiple aces
# sum of 2 + 11 + 5 + 11 exceeds 21 so one of aces must be worth 1
# player turn
# player goes first and can decide to hit or stay
# hit means the player will ask for another card
# if the total exceeds 21 then the player busts or loses
# decision to hit or stay will depend on what the players cards are
# and what the player thinks the dealer has
# player can continue to hit as many times as they want
# turn is over when the player either busts or stays
# if player busts, game is over and dealer won
# dealer turn
# when the player stays, its the dealers turn
# the dealer must follow a strict rule for determining
# whether to hit or stay
# hit until the total is at least 17
# if dealer busts then the player wins
# when both player and dealer stay, its time to compare
# the total value of the cards and see who has the highest value
